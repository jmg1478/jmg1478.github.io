            Hey there! Here is some fun facts about me. I can build a car from the ground up but I can also build a computer 
        blindfolded. On a normal weekend, you will find me up in the mountains with my wife camping and hiking or hanging out with our families. 
        I am from San Diego, Californa. I have lived here all my life but I have traveled a lot. Currently, I have been to almost every state and
        6 different countries. My wife and I have the travel bug so we do travel often. I work in finance, mostly helping people in debt figure out 
        a way to get out of it as painlessly as possible. The best part about work is that I work with my wife. On my down time, when I get it, I stream 
        video games on Facebook. Mostly FPS (First Person Shooter) games. I have about 750 active followers spanning from the United States to India.
