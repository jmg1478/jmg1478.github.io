        <h3>About Me</h3>
            <span>
                I have alway found "About Me" interesting, only when they are about other people. 
                How does anyone know what to say about themselves? Might be easier for someone else to write the 
                "About me" for the person then them doing it themselves. It's even harder for me because I actually 
                find myself boring. But I'll give it my best try!

                    I can build a car from the ground up but I can also build a computer blindfolded. On a normal weekend, 
                    you will find me up in the mountains with my wife camping and hiking or hanging out with our families. 
                    I am from San Diego, Californa. I have lived here all my life but I have traveled a lot. Currently, I 
                    have been to almost every state and 6 different countries. My wife and I have the travel bug so we do 
                    travel often.

                    I work in finance, mostly helping people in debt figure out a way to get out of it as 
                    painlessly as possible. The best part about work is that I work with my wife. Yes, ths means when I am
                    not here or the gym I am alway within a 10ft radius of her. People always ask "How do you guys do it?".
                    It's simple, we know eachother limits, boundries (for the most part), and we never let "work us" effect 
                    "home us".

                    On my down time, when I get it, I stream video games on Facebook. Mostly FPS (First Person Shooter) 
                    games. I have about 750 active followers spanning from the United States to India.

                    I truly belive you get what you put into life. I try to give 100% in everything I do otherwise what the point in 
                  doing it in the first place.
